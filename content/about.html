<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Scott is a PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale University, where he is developing computational methods for the analysis of single-cell genomics data under the supervision of Professor Smita Krishnaswamy and Professor Ronald Coifman. Scott completed his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics &amp; Statistics at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Scott previously worked Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where he developed computational methods for detecting and analysing epigenetic modifications to DNA in nanopore sequencing under the supervision of Professor Terry Speed. Scott's research focuses on the ability of machine learning techniques, and in particular deep learning and manifold learning, to simplify the analysis of high-throughput, high-dimensional data in the biomedical sciences.</p>
