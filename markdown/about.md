# About

Scott is a PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale
University, where he is developing computational methods for the analysis of
single-cell genomics data under the supervision of Professor Smita Krishnaswamy
and Professor Ronald Coifman.
Scott completed his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics & Statistics at the University of
Melbourne, Australia. Scott previously worked Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where he developed
computational methods for detecting and analysing epigenetic modifications to
DNA in nanopore sequencing under the supervision of Professor Terry Speed. 
Scott\'s research focuses on the ability of machine learning techniques, and in particular
deep learning and manifold learning, to simplify the analysis of high-throughput,
high-dimensional data in the biomedical sciences.
